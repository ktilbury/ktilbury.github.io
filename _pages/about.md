I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Waterloo, where I am advised by [Jesse Hoey](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jhoey/). I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning, agent based modelling, and social and affective computing.

I received a Master of Computer Science from the Dalhousie University. My masters thesis was on domain dependence of word embeddings for biomedical natural language processing, supervised by [Evangelos E. Milios](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~eem/) and [Meng He]( https://web.cs.dal.ca/~mhe/).
