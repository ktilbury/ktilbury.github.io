I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, where I am advised by [Jesse Hoey](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jhoey/). My research can broadly be categorized as developing and understanding socially aligned AI. This includes studying how groups of artificial agents can understand and contend with various human social factors in simulated and real-world environments. My research encompasses several domains, particularly reinforcement learning, social and affective computing, and multiagent systems. 

I received a Master of Computer Science from Dalhousie University. My master's thesis was on domain dependence of word embeddings for biomedical natural language processing, supervised by [Evangelos E. Milios](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~eem/) and [Meng He]( https://web.cs.dal.ca/~mhe/).
